GitHub does not support gradient colors, so I recommend downloading the attached PDF files to view the reports in their entirety.

Browse, download the PDFs and enjoy the full visual experience! Remember that the .pbix files require Power BI Desktop or Power BI Service for full viewing - enjoy and share your feedback!

Project 4 is still in progress
